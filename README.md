## OnePipe v1 - Documentation

This suite of APIs provides access to an array of payment-related services like card charging, airtime, bill payment, instant loans and KYC lookup services. Some of these services come from multiple providers like Interswitch, Flutterwave and Paystack, but OnePipe wraps around them an abstraction layer with one major goal: To provide a consistent interface to integrators regardless of underlying service provider. That way, you can switch between providers at any time, based on quality of service, business justification, etc. without starting a new integration project or changing your systems in any way.
